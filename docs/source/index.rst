Welcome to pyrevolt
===================

**pyrevolt** (\pie·ruh·vowlt\) is a Python library to wrap the Revolt
API, made to be *easy-to-use* but *powerful* and feature rich.

.. note::

   pyrevolt is in alpha/development stages. Exceptions may occur and bugs are likely.
   You should report them as soon as you find them to the `pyrevolt issue tracker <https://github.com/pyrevolt/pyrevolt/issues>`_.

Getting started
===============

To get started with pyrevolt, you can check out our :ref:`installation`
and :doc:`quickstart` guides. These guides will walk through the very
first steps of using pyrevolt.

Missing Content
===============

The library is currently missing the following features:
- Icons and their associated management
- Attachments and their associated management
- Permissions (obtainable, but not manageable)
- Invites and their associated management
- Creating a group
- Adding or removing a member from a group
- Voice
- Creating a server channel
- Editing a member of a server

These features are planned throughout the development of pyrevolt, but were not deemed necessary at the current state.
